# UML Design Tools

---

Several tools exist for creating UML, or class diagrams, preparatory to coding a project. Online tools such as <a href="https://www.drawio.com">Drawio</a> are great! However, for those with a preference to use in-editor tools I have found the extensions below to be useful.

## UmLet by The UmLet Team

Direct from the UmLet website:

"UMLet is a free, open-source UML tool with a simple user interface: draw UML diagrams fast, create sequence and activity diagrams from plain text, share via exports to eps, pdf, jpg, svg, and clipboard, and develop new, custom UML elements."

"Find below the full-featured UMLet as <a href="https://www.umlet.com/changes.htm">stand-alone app</a> for Windows, macOS, and Linux, or as Eclipse plugin. It is also available as a <a href="https://www.umletino.com">web app</a> called UmLetino, and as <a href="https://marketplace.cursorapi.com/items?itemName=theumletteam.umlet">extension</a> to Visual Studio Code."

 So far, my primary application of this tool has been in designing class diagrams for relatively basic C# programs while at University. For example, the below class diagram is for a mindfullness activities app:
